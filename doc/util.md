# Utility Predicates

This module defines generic utility predicates, useful for defining
languages.

## Collection Predicates

The predicates defined in this section operate on lists and vectors,
commonly referred to as _collections_.

### Abstract Collections

The following predicates provide an abstraction layer on top of lists and
vectors, allowing calling definitions to be agnostic of their underlying
type.

`empty?` matches a collection with a Boolean, determining if it's empty.
The default rule will just return `false`.
```clojure
(all [coll]
     (empty? coll false))

```
Special cases for an empty vector and an empty list return `true`.
```clojure
(fact
     (empty? [] true))
(fact
     (empty? () true))

(assert
 (empty? [] true)
 (empty? () true)
 (empty? [1] false)
 (empty? (2) false)
 (empty? :not-a-collection false))

```
`decons` deconstructs a collection by returning its first element (head) and
the remaining collection (tail).

It fails for all non-collections
```clojure
(all [coll head tail]
     (decons coll head tail
             ! coll "is not a collection"))

```
Non-empty lists and vectors are handled as follows:
```clojure
(all [x xs]
     (decons [x & xs] x xs))
(all [x xs]
     (decons (x & xs) x xs))

```
A special explanation is given for the failed case of empty lists and
vectors.
```clojure
(all [x xs]
     (decons [] x xs ! "Attempt to deconstruct an empty vector"))
(all [x xs]
     (decons () x xs ! "Attempt to deconstruct an empty list"))

(assert
 (decons [1 2 3] 1 [2 3])
 (decons (1 2 3) 1 (2 3))
 (decons [1] 1 [])
 (exist [x xs]
        (decons [] x xs) ! "Attempt to deconstruct an empty vector")
 (exist [x xs]
        (decons () x xs) ! "Attempt to deconstruct an empty list"))

```
#### A Collection of Pairs

In some cases it may be useful to treat the members of a collection as
pairs. These could be, for example, variable names coupled with expressions
to initialize them, as in `let` expressions in Clojure.

Collections of the form `(pairs coll)`, where `coll` is some collection are
interpreted as collections of pairs of consecutive elements from the
underlying collection. For example, `(pair [1 2 3 4])` contains the elements
`[1 2]` and `[3 4]`.

We define `empty?` on `(pairs coll)` as `empty?` on `coll`.
```clojure
(all [coll res]
     (empty? (pairs coll res)) <-
     (empty? coll res))

(assert
 (empty? (pairs (1 2 3 4) false))
 (empty? (pairs () true)))

```
For `decons`, we call `decons` on the underlying `coll` while checking
`empty?` between them.
```clojure
(all [coll x y xys]
     (decons (pairs coll) [x y] (pairs xys)) <-
     (exist [yxys]
            (decons coll x yxys)
            (empty? yxys false ! x "is unmatched")
            (decons yxys y xys)))

(assert
 (decons (pairs [1 2 3 4]) [1 2] (pairs [3 4]))
 (exist [x xs]
        (decons (pairs [1]) x xs)
        ! 1 "is unmatched"))

```
### Verifying Elements

Here we define two predicates that verify that the elements of a collection
(vector or list) all meet a certain criterion. In order to be able to do
this we need to first define an abstraction for defining predicates on the
elements. To do so, we define `is`, a predicate that takes a `description`
and a term and accepts the term if it matches the description.

By default, `is` will reject the description.
```clojure
(all [desc term]
     (is desc term ! desc "is not a valid term description"))

```
A description of `symbol` requires that the term is a symbol.
```clojure
(all [term]
     (is symbol term) <-
     (inspect term :symbol ! "Expected a symbol, received" term))

(assert
 (is symbol foo)
 (is symbol 42 ! "Expected a symbol, received" 42)
 (is not-a-description foo
     ! not-a-description "is not a valid term description"))

```
`vector-of` is a predicate that takes a term expected to be a vector and a
description for its elements. It accepts vectors where all elements match
the description.
```clojure
(all [vec desc]
     (vector-of vec desc ! vec "is not a vector"))
(all [x xs desc]
     (vector-of [x & xs] desc) <-
     (is desc x)
     (vector-of xs desc))
(all [desc]
     (vector-of [] desc))

(assert
 (vector-of [a b c] symbol)
 (vector-of [a 3 c] symbol ! "Expected a symbol, received" 3)
 (vector-of (a b c) symbol ! (a b c) "is not a vector"))

```
Similarly, `list-of` accepts a list of element that match the given
description.
```clojure
(all [list desc]
     (list-of list desc ! list "is not a list"))
(all [x xs desc]
     (list-of (x & xs) desc) <-
     (is desc x)
     (list-of xs desc))
(all [desc]
     (list-of () desc))

(assert
 (list-of (a b c) symbol)
 (list-of (a 3 c) symbol ! "Expected a symbol, received" 3)
 (list-of [a b c] symbol ! [a b c] "is not a list"))

```
### Matching Collections

Often we need to match two collections, element by element, making sure that
they are of the same size. One example where this is useful is when
validating arguments based on the parameter definitions.

Similarly to how when verifying single elements we used a _description_, to
handle the relationship between two elements we define a family of terms
named _relations_. A relation describes the relationship between two things.
The predicate `have-relation` takes a relation and two values and accepts
them if the values have the given relationship.

The base rule rejects all (undefined) relations.
```clojure
(all [rel a b]
     (have-relation rel a b ! "Undefined relation" rel))

```
The relation `=` requires that the two values are equal.
```clojure
(all [a b]
     (have-relation = a b) <-
     (= a b ! "Expected" a "to equal" b "but they differ"))

```
The predicate `match-vector` takes a vector, a collection, a relation and a
string representing the vector and checks a member-wise relation between the
respective elements.
```clojure
(all [vec coll rel name]
     (match-vector vec coll rel name ! "match-vector expects a vector, but" vec "is given"))
(all [x xs coll rel name]
     (match-vector [x & xs] coll rel name) <-
     (empty? coll false ! "Too many" name "provided." x "is extra")
     (exist [y coll']
            (decons coll y coll')
            (have-relation rel x y)
            (match-vector xs coll' rel name)))
(all [coll rel name]
     (match-vector [] coll rel name) <-
     (empty? coll true ! "Too few" name "provided." coll "are unmatched"))

```
These rules handle both the cases of the vector and collection being eual in
size and the vector being longer or shorter.
```clojure
(assert
 (match-vector [1 2 3] (1 2 3) = "numbers")
 (match-vector [1 2 3] (1 2) = "numbers"
               ! "Too many" "numbers" "provided." 3 "is extra")
 (match-vector [1 2] (1 2 3) = "numbers"
               ! "Too few" "numbers" "provided." (3) "are unmatched")
 (match-vector [1 2 3] (1 4 3) = "numbers"
               ! "Expected" 2 "to equal" 4 "but they differ"))

```
Similarly, `match-list` matches a list to a collection.
```clojure
(all [list coll rel name]
     (match-list list coll rel name ! "match-list expects a list, but" list "is given"))
(all [x xs coll rel name]
     (match-list (x & xs) coll rel name) <-
     (empty? coll false ! "Too many" name "provided." x "is extra")
     (exist [y coll']
            (decons coll y coll')
            (have-relation rel x y)
            (match-list xs coll' rel name)))
(all [coll rel name]
     (match-list () coll rel name) <-
     (empty? coll true ! "Too few" name "provided." coll "are unmatched"))

(assert
 (match-list (1 2 3) [1 2 3] = "numbers")
 (match-list (1 2 3) [1 2] = "numbers"
             ! "Too many" "numbers" "provided." 3 "is extra")
 (match-list (1 2) [1 2 3] = "numbers"
             ! "Too few" "numbers" "provided." [3] "are unmatched")
 (match-list (1 2 3) [1 4 3] = "numbers"
             ! "Expected" 2 "to equal" 4 "but they differ"))
```
