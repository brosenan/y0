# `y0lsp`: A Universal Language Server based on $y_0$

The goal of this project is to create a universal language server, implementing
the [Language Server
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) that uses $y_0$
([link](../)) as a way to define languages.

The idea is:

* You provide a declarative definition of the language + some configuration.
* We provide a language sever for it.

`y0lsp` is designed around a plug-in approach, where different plug-ins
implement different LSP services.

This project is work in progress, so stay tuned for updates.
