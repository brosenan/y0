;; # Why-Not Explanations

;; One of the most important features of $y_0$, and the one that gave it its
;; name, is its ability to convey explanations as to why a certain AST _does
;; not_ comply with the defined language.

;; In the following sections we describe $y_0$'s support for why-not
;; explanations.

;; ## Failing Rules

;; Rules that fail need to provide an explanation. We have already seen one
;; example of this, in the base-rule of
;; [the `bit` predicate, defined in the introduction](hello.md#predicates).
;; This provided the explanation that anything that is not explicitly defined
;; as a bit in any of the following rules (i.e., `0` or `1`) is not a bit.
(assert
 (bit 5 ! "Expected a bit, received" 5))

;; We can define another failing rule for `bit` rejecting yet another value
;; with a different explanation
(all []
     (bit 2 ! "2 is not a bit value. Only 0 and 1"))

(assert
 (bit 2 ! "2 is not a bit value. Only 0 and 1"))

;; ## Explanation Context

;; A good explanation points to the root cause of the issue. However, sometimes
;; the root cause by itself is not explanation enough.

;; As an example, consider we wish to define `bit-stream` as a language of
;; vectors of bits. We begin by defining `bit-vec`, a predicate that accepts
;; bit vectors.
(all [bv]
     (bit-vec bv ! bv "is not a bit-vector"))
(all [b bv]
     (bit-vec [b & bv]) <-
     (bit b)
     (bit-vec bv))
(all []
     (bit-vec []))

;; This predicate accepts vectors of bits and rejects anything else.
(assert
 (bit-vec [1 0 1 0])
 (bit-vec [1 0 2 0]
          ! "2 is not a bit value. Only 0 and 1")
 (bit-vec :foo ! :foo "is not a bit-vector"))

;; Now we define `bit-stream`. The AST `(bitvec vec...)` is defined as a bit
;; stream.
(all [bs]
     (bit-stream bs ! bs "is not a bit-stream"))
(all [bv]
     (bit-stream (bitvec bv)) <-
     (bit-vec bv ! "in" bv))

(assert
 (bit-stream (bitvec [1 0 1]))
 (bit-stream (bitvec [1 0 2 0])
          ! "2 is not a bit value. Only 0 and 1" "in" [1 0 2 0]))

;; ## Context for Assertions

;; One specific case in which context is important are assertion blocks that
;; are the result of a [translation rule](statements.md#translation-rules)
;; working on some statement. In such cases, we often wish to know which
;; statement was the origin for the assertion.

;; $y_0$ does so automatically. It tracks, for each statement that is generated
;; by a translation rule, what statement was its origin. Then it provides this
;; origin as context to assertions within any generated assertion block.

;; For example, let us consider a `defoo` definition, similar to the one
;; defined in our discussion of
;; [translation rules](statements.md#translation-rules). This version, however,
;; adds a restriction that a `foo` must be a symbol.
(all [x]
     (defoo x) =>
     (assert
      (is-symbol x))
     (all [] (foo x)))

;; Where `is-symbol` is defined as follows:
(all [x]
     (is-symbol x) <-
     (inspect x :symbol ! x "is not a symbol"))

;; The statement `defoo` which is defined here translates to an assertion that
;; the defined thing is a symbol. Then it contributes a rule to the `foo`
;; predicate. Please note that `defoo` here is separate from the original one
;; as it is defined witin a different namespace. However, we import `foo` to
;; reuse the symbol from its original definition.

;; Now, `defoo` statements with non-symbols will fail.
(assert
 (given (defoo x)
        (foo x))
 (given (defoo "x") ! "x" "is not a symbol" "in" (defoo "x")))

;; In case where an assert-block is resulting from a chained translation, the
;; original statement is presented as context.

;; For example, let us define `defoo'` as a statement that translates to
;; `defoo`.
(all [x]
     (defoo' x) => (defoo x))

;; An error in `defoo'` will be reported with `defoo'`, rather than `defoo` as
;; context.
(assert
 (given (defoo' x)
        (foo x))
 (given (defoo' "x") ! "x" "is not a symbol" "in" (defoo' "x")))
